Please update `README.md` (at the root of the project), and ensure it properly and thoroughly documents how to use the `ormantism` library (`tests` may be useful).

Also mention `ormantism/REFERENCE.md`, as a file where class and methods definitions and uses are listed (have a look at it to write a good description).
